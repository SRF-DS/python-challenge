Documentation of my process to complete the python - challenge:

Conceptual Framework I began by determining that using pandas dataframes and the jupyter notebook is the most efficient way of completing this challenge.
The most interesting, applicable and powerful data analysis tool we have learned so far is using python combined with jupyter notebook.
Functions downstream from using these tools I determined is the easiest method of drilling down on this data.
  -Testing code as I go
  -running smaller portions of the code
  - simpler saving
