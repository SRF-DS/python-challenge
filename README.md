Documentation of my process to complete the python - challenge:

Conceptual Framework I began witht the question "what is the most efficient way of completing this challenge?"
I determined that would be using pandas dataframes and the jupyter notebook because it is the most powerful data analysis tool we have learned so far.
Functions downstream from using these tools I determined is the easiest method of drilling down on this data.
  -Testing code as I go
  -running smaller portions of the code
  - simpler saving
  - simpler debugging

1st Reference for sourcing code : 
PythonDALesson2 (from second day of class)
